Task type: IMPLEMENTATION

Approved design summary:
[paste the agreed solution]

Instructions:
1) Implement exactly what was approved — nothing more.
2) Do NOT refactor unrelated code.
3) Respect existing architecture and patterns.
4) Add tests ONLY where explicitly requested.
5) After implementation, provide:
   - Summary of changes
   - Files changed
   - How to verify manually

Constraints:
- No speculative improvements
- No renaming unless required
- If something blocks implementation, STOP and report
