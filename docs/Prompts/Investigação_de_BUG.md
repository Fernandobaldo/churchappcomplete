Task type: BUG INVESTIGATION (NO CODE YET)

Problem statement:
[describe the observed behavior]
Example:
- During onboarding, user can create multiple churches if onboarding is abandoned.
- When member.branchId is null, the churches endpoint returns empty even if a church exists.

Instructions:
1) Do NOT change any code.
2) Inspect the current logic end-to-end:
   - backend routes
   - services
   - database queries
   - mobile/web assumptions
3) Identify:
   - Where the behavior originates (exact file + function)
   - Why it happens (root cause, not symptom)
   - Which invariants are currently violated
4) List:
   - Primary root cause
   - Secondary contributing factors (if any)
5) Describe at least 2 possible fixes:
   - minimal / low-risk
   - more structural / long-term
6) For each fix, include:
   - pros
   - cons
   - impact on existing flows

Output:
- A clear, structured analysis (no code)
- Use bullet points and sections
- Quote exact files/functions when possible

Constraints:
- Do not guess missing behavior
- If information is insufficient, explicitly say “UNKNOWN” and list questions
